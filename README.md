# YouTube-Income-Estimator
This program uses the Youtube API to scrap data from the 10 most subsrcibed Youtubers. This then takes the
last 50 videos of each of the youtubers and accumulates the views. These views are then calculated to 
determine how much they earned. Then, I integrated the program with a MySQL database to store and manage each 
Youtube channelâ€™s data including view count, subscribers, estimated earnings, and extraction timestamps
